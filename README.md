## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Through the summary statistics I was able to see that the two variables that provided non-random amounts of variance to the MPG values in the dataset are Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance.
In addition, because the slope was so much smaller than the p-value, this is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
I believe that this model does predict MPG of the protypes effectively, because the r-squared value is .7149 or 71.5%. That number means that data points in the future have about a 71.5% chance of fitting into this model.
